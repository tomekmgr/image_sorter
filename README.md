Simple and fast sorting tool for media files (images and videos).

It runs in a current working folder looking for media files, once scanned, it prepares dedicated folders in convention `./YYYY/MM/file`
So, after few seconds, all your library is sorted in separate folders as `Years`, then `Months` inside.
